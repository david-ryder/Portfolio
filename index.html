            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is David Winfield. I am currently a senior attending the 
                University of Central Florida, and I am studying to get my Bachelors in
                Computer Science. I am looking for internships/other job opportunities 
                in Software Engineering for when I graduate in May 2023. I am very passionate
                about the tech field and I enjoy learning new technologies in my free time. I
                actually made this website all by myself using HTML and CSS! If you're reading this,
                I'd love to get in contact you, as I will be looking for a Software Engineering role
                after graduating.
