                <h3>The Walt Disney Company</h3>
                <p>I used to work as a lifeguard at The Walt Disney Company, located in Orlando, FL. 
                    I started out working at one of the waterparks, Blizzard Beach, and then later
                    transferred to a resort region where I got to guard at Disney's Boardwalk and
                    Disney's Yacht Club Resort/Disney's Beach Club Resort. Throughout my time guarding
                    for Disney, I was nominated three times for my work efforts and got experience dealing
                    with guests, working in a team with other Cast Members, and coordinating with leaders
                    and coordinators to ensure a safe environment for the thousands of guests that frequent
                    our pool spaces.

            <div id="projects">
                <h1>Projects</h1>

                <p>Every one of the below projects are displayed on my GitHub account, including code samples
                    and the occassional video demonstration of the functionality of each project.
                </p>

                <h3>This Website!</h3>
                <p>The website you are currently looking at was fully designed and implemented by me! It uses
                    mainly HTML and CSS and as you can tell from the site's address, it is hosted on GitHub. 
                    Prior to starting this project, I knew very little about web development. Howevever, after
                    taking time to learn and research how to undertake a project such as this one, I gave myself a
                    goal to finish it in under a week. This is how it turned out!
                </p>

                <h3>Discord MongoDB Bot</h3>
                <p>Using Discord's Python API and Mongo Database, I created a bot that can be used in the 
                    tabletop role playing game Dungeons and Dragons. To use the bot, a user would upload 
                    the stat sheet for the character that they want to use for the game, and the bot will
                    automatically parse the stat sheet for its information then upload said information to 
                    MongoDB. Once data has been uploaded, the bot can now perform any roll required using the
                    uploaded stat sheet. For example, if a user is performing a strength check or an attack roll, 
                    the bot would automatically roll the required dice, add whatever bonuses the user's 
                    character has, and then display the randomly rolled results in the Discord chat. Users 
                    can also change the color of the bot, print out their stat sheet in the chat.
                </p>

                <h3>Selenium Repost Bot</h3>
                <p>Using Selenium webdriver and a bit of Python, I created a bot for a local cat breeding business
                    to increase their online presence. I was the lead designer and programmer for this project. The cat breeders frequently used a site called gokitty.com,
                    where cat owners list their cats up for adoption to potential customers. To save the business time,
                    my bot was commissioned. My bot essentially took information from whatever original posts the
                    business made, copied all its data, and then made fresh posts with the same information and pictures.
                    This enabled the business to frequently shoot to the top of the results page because the site displayed
                    new posts first, so the business would display its inventory to more potential buyers.
                </p>

                <h3>Dynamic Programming Practice</h3>
                <p>In my second Data Structures & Algorithms class, I completed a dynamic programming assignment
                    using Java. In this assignment, I was given a list of blocks with respective integer values.
                    My task was to solve the following question: if I can only take a block that is not next to
                    one that has already been taken, what is the maximum possible sum that can be attained from
                    the set? To avoid extensive an extensive runtime that a recursive solution could cause and
                    to avoid repeated calculation, I needed to use dynamic programming to save space and time to
                    get the optimal solution to the problem.
                </p>

                <h3>Roblox Studio Video Game</h3>
                <p>Over the Summer of 2021, I was approached by a group to assist in the development of their
                    video game that they intended to release on the popular video game platform, Roblox. Throughout
                    this project, I worked as the lead developer in a team of 9 other people including graphic designers,
                    3D modelers, and other developers. I created a number of different scripts needed to help the game run,
                    including designing a basic health bar system for players and enemies, creating function medieval weapons,
                    and creating a target lock system that would allow the player to swivel the camera to target the
                    closest enemy to them as well as switch between enemies as needed. Unfortunately, this project never
                    came to fruition due to design issues, but I learned how to work in a team to create a video game.
                    I also learned that I would love to return to video game development as a hobby or 
                    professional career. On my GitHub, I have the full target lock script available for viewing.
                    It uses vectors, calculations of angles, and many other math components to make it functional.

                <h1>How I Stay Involved In Computer Science</h1>

                <h3>KnightHacks</h3>
                <p>KnightHacks is my university's largest programming club. They frequently run workshops to
                    teach programming technologies and languages to its members, as well as give its members
                    a space to socialize with other students involved in the computer science career field.
                    Currently, I am looking to take on the club's Treasurer position for the 2022-2023 school
                    year.
                </p>

                <h3>School Projects</h3>
                <p>Being a Computer Science major, many of the courses I take/have taken involve coding. 
                    Throughout my education at UCF, I have mainly been taught C and Java, which are the two
                    languages I have had the most experience with. These school projects challenge me to learn
                    how to solve problems from a very technical perspective, especially in my Data Structures &
                    Algorithms classes. But other courses have enabled me to exercise my more creative muscles
                    in my brain by letting me pursue more fun projects such as creating a mobile game using Unity
                    game engine.
                </p>

                <h3>LeetCode Interview Practice</h3>
                <p>For technical interviews, I am frequently asked to do coding challenges to put my skills to the
                    test. I grind out practice interview questions on the popular site LeetCode to review my knowledge
                    of Data Structures & Algorithms, as well as my knowledge of syntax in my most used programming
                    languages.
                </p>

                <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
                <p>When I'm not completing school projects or grinding out LeetCode problems, I pursue personal
                    projects. These are projects that allow me to take my technical knowledge of programming and 
                    software engineering to solve or model real world problems. With every project, I have learned
                    a new software engineering technology and gotten more of a taste of what it would be like to 
                    work with these technologies in the field. I have enjoyed every project I've worked on, and have
                    fallen in love with the development field because of it!
